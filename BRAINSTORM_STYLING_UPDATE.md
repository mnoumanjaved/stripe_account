# Brainstorm App Styling Update

## ✅ Completed: Integrated Brainstorm App with Main App Design

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Added Main App Layout**
- **Header**: Added `CreativeAgencyHeader` to brainstorm page
- **Footer**: Added `CreativeAgencyFooter` to brainstorm page
- **Back to Top**: Added scroll-to-top button
- **Magic Cursor**: Integrated custom cursor from main app
- **Smooth Scroll**: Added smooth scrolling wrapper

#### 2. **Updated Page Structure**
File: `src/app/brainstorm/page.tsx`
- Wrapped content with proper header/footer
- Added container and section spacing (`pt-150 pb-120`)
- Integrated with main app's smooth scroll system
- Added proper Suspense fallback with header/footer

#### 3. **Updated Form Styling**
File: `src/components/brainstorm/BriefForm.tsx`
- **Title**: Changed from "IDEA RIOT" dark theme to professional heading
  - Now uses: `tp-section-title-2` class
  - Added descriptive subtitle
- **Form Fields**: Replaced dark Tailwind classes with Bootstrap classes
  - `form-control` for inputs/textareas
  - `form-select` for dropdowns
  - `form-label` for labels
- **Button**: Changed from dark blue to main app's style
  - Now uses: `tp-btn-red` class
  - Updated text: "Start Brainstorming"
- **Spacing**: Updated to use Bootstrap spacing (`mb-30`, `pt-30`, etc.)

#### 4. **Updated Global Styles**
File: `src/app/globals.scss`
- Added `.brainstorm-app` wrapper class
- Override Tailwind dark colors to light theme:
  - `text-slate-200` → Dark gray `#1e293b`
  - `bg-slate-800` → Light gray `#f8fafc`
  - `text-slate-400` → Medium gray `#64748b`
  - `bg-white/5` → White `#ffffff`
  - `border-white/10` → Light border `#e2e8f0`
  - All blues remain blue but adjusted for light theme

### Result:

The `/brainstorm` page now:
✅ Has the same header and footer as the main app
✅ Uses the main app's color scheme (light theme)
✅ Uses Bootstrap form styling instead of dark Tailwind
✅ Has proper spacing and typography matching the main app
✅ Integrates with the main app's cursor and scroll animations
✅ Looks like a native part of the main application

### Before vs After:

**Before:**
- Dark blue/slate background (#0a0e17)
- Custom dark Tailwind styling
- No header/footer
- "IDEA RIOT" branding
- Isolated dark theme

**After:**
- Light background matching main app
- Bootstrap form components
- CreativeAgencyHeader & Footer
- Professional "AI-Powered Creative Brainstorming" title
- Fully integrated with main app design system

### Testing:

Run the app and visit:
```
http://localhost:3000/brainstorm
```

The page should now look and feel like part of the main application!
